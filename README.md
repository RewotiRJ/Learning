# eduhacks-Collab
A working demo of a collaborative learning platform developed by Wilson Adhikari and myself with UX design by Bella Margolles and Qing Yao

## What is Collab?
Online Lab where students can join a chat and collaborate together on a whiteboard setup created using a canvas in HTML and ran on a node.js backend with client synchronization done with websockets via socket.io.

## Setup
Run npm install in both drawing/ and chat/ with their own terminal windows

Start both of the servers, "node client.js" and "npm start" respectively

Open main.html to get the collab work page
